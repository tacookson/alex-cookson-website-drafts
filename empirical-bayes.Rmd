Introduction. Children's books ratings with breakdown of 1-5 stars:

1. Recommend / Don't recommend
2. Star rating inference with shrinkage


## Setup


## Data inspection


## Other

Things to consider:

- Shrinking towards a prior distribution
- Adding regression to account for other factors (e.g., author, number of pages, year published)
- Normalizing: many reviews fall in a narrow band, so is there a way to get a more useful rating without having to consider most books falling between 3.9 to 4.2
