Main points:

- A compelling or interesting dataset can be a significant motivator for people to use and learn R
- The datasets we use are important (see iris dataset as a default vs. Palmer Penguins as a proposed replacement)
- Curating datasets is a learning opportunity in and of itself (especially data cleaning, web scraping, and creative problem-solving)
- Output of curating datasets -- the datasets themselves -- are a worthy and useful contribution to the R community as a whole (and beyond, since a CSV or TSV file is language-agnostic)
