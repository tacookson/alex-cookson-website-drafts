Who is the audience? Teachers (who put together instructional materials) and Learners (who are looking for projects to develop their skills)


Convince audience of two things:

1. You should care about datasets: The datasets we use to teach and learn are **important**. They are more than a means of illustrating or teaching a concept.
1. You should curate your own datasets: Datasets are an accessible way for learners to get their hands dirty with projects and they are a way to contribute to the community.


### You should care about datasets

Datasets as a way to engage learners:

- A compelling dataset will make someone exclaim, "Wow! That's so cool!"
    - Katherine Goode using bat movement data to illustrate `gganimate` on a Halloween-day presentation (https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.421) and (https://goodekat.github.io/presentations/2019-isugg-gganimate-spooky/slides.html#1)
    - Marine biology lecturers using cetaceans dataset from Tidy Tuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-12-18)

- Learners will feel compelled to ask questions and answer them, which flips the standard "data-technique" relationship. Instead of using data as a way to illustrate a technique, the technique becomes a means to getting an answer to a burning question out of the data.



Datasets reflect the values of our community:

- Iris dataset, one of the classic illustrative datasets, was first published by Ronald Fisher in the *Annals of Eugenics*
    - The first sentence of the foreward of the first issue of the *Annals of Eugenics* is: "The time seems fully ripe  for the issue of  a journal which shall devote its pages wholly to the scientific treatment of  racial problems in man." (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1925.tb02036.x)
    - The first paragraph of the paper in which Iris appears states that Fisher is applying a principle from craniometry to Iris taxonomy (https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15227/1/138.pdf)
- Blog post on the problems of Iris: https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/

- Palmer Penguins dataset (https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) is a great alternative, without problematic connections to eugenics, with the bonus of being crazy-cute (https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)
- Making data available is a step to making issues visible, because data can answer questions or provide new perspectives:
    - Public policy (e.g., biking count data)
    - Social issues (e.g, American Slavery and Juneteenth (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-06-16/readme.md))
    - Highlighting things that don't get the attention they deserve (e.g, women's sports (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-09))


### Learn from Curating!

- Goal: get already-existing data into a tidy format (ready for Tidy Tuesday!)
- Classic advice for learners is to work on a project. This is much easier if a dataset already taps into an existing interest.
- It's a repeatable project with lots of variation and degrees of difficulty, depending on the dataset being curated
- Things I've learned by curating datasets:
    - Webscraping with `rvest`
    - Extracting data from PDFs with `pdftools` (https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-04-03-beer-and-pdftools-a-vignette/)
    - Setting up and using Google Translate API with `googleLanguageR`
    - Iterating with `purrr`
    - Endless data cleaning of data "in the wild" with `dplyr` (joins, de-duplication, `pivot_wider`/`pivot_longer`, `coalesce`, `fill`, `case_when`, lots of regular expressions)
    
    
### Appendix

Main points:

- A compelling or interesting dataset can be a significant motivator for people to use and learn R
- The datasets we use are important (see iris dataset as a default vs. Palmer Penguins as a proposed replacement)
- Curating datasets is a learning opportunity in and of itself (especially data cleaning, web scraping, and creative problem-solving)
- Output of curating datasets -- the datasets themselves -- are a worthy and useful contribution to the R community as a whole (and beyond, since a CSV or TSV file is language-agnostic)
